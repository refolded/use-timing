## What is it?

Working with time is a common task in React applications and for some reason it is not natively intuitive to do so. To solve this, most React libraries provide a set of hooks that allow you to work with time, a lot of them including two most basic hooks from this post by Dan Abramov.

At first this library included a basic implementation of useInterval as defined in that post as well as its counterpart useTimeout, however we eventually realized that there's more that can be done with them and so the library now extends their functionality while also providing a multitude of other hooks that streamline some common use-cases that could come up for the two hooks.

**From `v2.0` onwards, all use-timing hooks now return objects instead of arrays**. While this makes it easier to pick just the property you need, it also means this is a major breaking change for previous users of the library. If you are using the library in a previous version, you should migrate to the new version by replacing the array syntax with object destructuring as shown below.

**All delay inputs for all hooks are in `milliseconds`**. If you need to work with large time-frames such as hours, days, weeks, months, years, etc, you should use a transformation library like [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) or multiplication with native `Date`. Examples using this are shown in the demo and in the `example` directory of this repository.
