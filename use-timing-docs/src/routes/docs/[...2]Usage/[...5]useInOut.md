# {$frontmatter.title}

Allows you to provide 2 callback functions, one will be executed as soon as the timer begins and the other at the end.

Technically the opposite of `useCycle`, instead of multiple delays this hook allows you to provide multiple functions that will be called at the start and end of the timer.

This hook is limited to 2 callbacks as inputs due to the implementation.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useInOut } from '@refolded/use-timing';

const App = () => {
	const [running, setRunning] = useState(false);

	const [delay, setDelay] = useState(500);

	const { start, stop } = useInOut(
		[
			// Will be executed immediately
			() => {
				setRunning(true);
			},
			// Will be executed after the duration of the timer
			() => {
				setRunning(false);
			}
		],
		delay
	);

	return (
		<div>
			<h1>{running}</h1>
			<div>
				<button onClick={start}>Start Count</button>
				<button onClick={stop}>Stop Count</button>
			</div>
		</div>
	);
};
```
