# {$frontmatter.title}

An abstraction of a common use-case for useInterval/setInterval is to cycle through a set of timers, for example when implementing a Pomodoro timer or cycling through multiple common delays.

useCycle provides a simplified wrapper around useInterval that allows you to cycle through any size set of delays infinitely.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useCycle } from '@refolded/use-timing';

const App = () => {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

	const [delay, setDelay] = useState(500);

	// You can add as many delays to the array as you like.
	const { start, stop, currentDelay } = useCycle(() => {
		setCount(count - 1);
	}, [delay, delay * 2, delay * 3]);

	return (
		<div>
			<h1>{count}</h1>
			<h2>{currentDelay}ms</h2>
			<div>
				<button onClick={start}>Start Count</button>
				<button onClick={stop}>Stop Count</button>
			</div>
		</div>
	);
};
```
