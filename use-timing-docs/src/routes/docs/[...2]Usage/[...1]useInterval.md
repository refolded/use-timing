# {$frontmatter.title}

useInterval allows you to call a function at a given interval, much like setInterval, with the advantage of not having to wrap it in complex behaviors in `useEffect` to clear the interval or reset.

The added benefit of a custom react hook is that the delay is dynamic, so you can dynamically change the delay parameter and on the next render the interval will automatically re-initialize with the new delay.

:::admonition type="warning"
From `v2.0` onwards, useInterval now returns an object containing `start` and `stop` rather than an array. These are functions that allow you to pause and unpause the interval at will. All hooks below also now return an object instead of an array.
:::

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useInterval } from '@refolded/use-timing';

const App = () => {
	// Classic example with a counter
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

	// Set a dynamic delay, you can also pass an absolute value.
	const [delay, setDelay] = useState(500);

	// The hooks return "start" and "stop" functions for controlling it.
	// Whenever the delay changes, the function dynamically reruns.
	const { start, stop } = useInterval(() => {
		setCount(count - 1);
	}, delay);

	// Examples for changing the speed on the fly.
	const halfSpeed = () => setDelay(delay * 2);
	const doubleSpeed = () => setDelay(delay / 2);

	return (
		<div>
			<h1>{count}</h1>
			<div>
				<button onClick={start}>Start Count</button>
				<button onClick={stop}>Stop Count</button>
				<button onClick={doubleSpeed}>Double speed</button>
				<button onClick={halfSpeed}>Half speed</button>
			</div>
		</div>
	);
};
```
