# {$frontmatter.title}

Calling this hook will return a function that will allow you to debounce any changes you need within the current component.

Unlike usual useDebounce implementations, this does not require passing values into it nor does it rely on any external data. The hook simply returns the debouncing function that you can use with any delay you want. This makes it very versatile in that it can debounce pretty much anything from inputs to API calls to button presses or entire renders.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useDebounce } from '@refolded/use-timing';

const Debounce = () => {
	const debounce = useDebounce();
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
	const [delay, setDelay] = useState(0);

	return (
		<>
			<span>{count}</span>
			<div>
				<input value={delay} onChange={(e) => setDelay(+e.target.value)} />
			</div>
			<div>
				<button
					onClick={() => {
						// Use it here to debounce setCount.
						debounce(() => {
							setCount(count + 1);
						}, delay);

						// It can even debounce async logic.
						debounce(async () => {
							const response = await fetch('myapiurl');
						}, 500);
					}}
				>
					Increase Count
				</button>
			</div>
		</>
	);
};
```
